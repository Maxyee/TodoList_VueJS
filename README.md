# vue-todo
Here is a simple Project called Vue todo list Which is a warmUp project for me for learning basic things about vue framework.
From this project a User can add todo to his todo list, delete todo from todo list and also he or she can see all the todolist 
from the Landing Page. I Use the Axios and JSonPlaceHolder Fake Api data so that I can replace those API in near future for my 
own backend Service

# Axios API Intigration To the Code Section
